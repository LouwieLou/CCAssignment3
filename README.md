# CCAssignment3


In order to run the code, we must ssh into the 2 chameleon cloud VMs. We have to make sure the containers are running on both VMs. In order for this to work, we have to run our custom docker image with premade commands. It runs on Ubuntu bionic. The containers will have kafka brokers on them with one acting as the master node and the others acting as worker nodes. Once this is done, kubernetes will be used to manage the cluster of containers so they can talk to each other. 

For this assignment, Louis and Tristan jointly managed the whole thing together since we could only work on one local machine. We guided each other through the installs and all the coding needed. We believe that this assignment had the biggest learning curve out of all the assignments. We felt lost more than we were sure about the project we were working on. It was also really hard since we didn't have a good base to start off with. Our assignments 1 and 2 were incomplete and we need more guidance.
